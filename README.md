# Parking-Management
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a Parking Management System designed to handle and manage cars inside a parking lot.
It allows you to add new cars, track their status, and manage their information using a simple interface.

The system uses a JSON file as a lightweight database to store data, and relies on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to manage car objects and their state
